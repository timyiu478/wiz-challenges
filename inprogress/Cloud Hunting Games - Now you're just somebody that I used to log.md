## Challenge

Wow, you rock! Now you know that the attacker has laterally moved from a workload within the organization to a high privileged machine, ssh-fetcher, via SSH. ExfilCola has granted you root access to the PostgreSQL service where this activity originated from.

ExfilCola really doesn't want to pay the ransom but can't afford for the secret recipe to be published. Can you save the day?

It seems like the attacker is persistent â€” literally...

Delete the secret recipe from the attacker's server.

## Solution
